## Mett's Dark Snek Syntax theme

A syntax highlighting theme for MagicPython based off 'One Dark' with lots of tweaks to the existing colors and several Python-specific syntax highlighting features not used in the original.

Intended for use with a dark ui theme.

Non-python languages will still retain the base syntax highlighting from the 'One Dark' syntax theme.
